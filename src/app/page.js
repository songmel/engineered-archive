          My interests lie in Computer Architecture, AI, Accelerators, and GPUs.
          I appreciate both the artistic and the engineering aspects of the worldâ€”perhaps, I believe, there is no boundary between them. In this fleeting moment of existence on this vast planet, I strive to reconstruct and preserve the knowledge I have gained in its most beautiful and precise form.
